Useful information:
-we will draw the city in the xOy coordinate system, the z component being the height;
- the entire map is stored in a two-dimensional matrix/vector, according to the following convention:

Convention:
    nothing = -3;
    water = -2;
    grass = -1;
    street = 0;
    1 <= building_1 <= 99;
    101 <= building_2 <= 199;
    201 <= building_3 <= 299;
    We notice that cells 100, 200, 300, etc. will not be used; we can store various things in them.
